	STEP 1
	Copy your utilities.js file into the same folder as this file

	STEP 2
	insert a <script></script> tag with a src property so that this file has access to the functions in utilities.js

	STEP 3
	Program the Run the button

	A click of the button will call the runLap function.

	STEP 4
	Write the runLap function.

	STEP 5
	Display the value of each mouse.

	STEP 6
	Update the runLaps function so that it uses getRandomInteger().

	STEP 7
	The race should run for 10 laps.  After 10 laps, we can determine a winner.

	Create a variable that keeps track of the number of laps and a constant that says which lap is the last one.

	Once the number of laps reaches that final number, the race should not continue, even if the player presses the button.

	Don't forget to display the lap number.

	STEP 8
	Formalized Display - Find the Leader

	Based on the lap number, the program should either say who is in the lead or it should say who won the race.

	A function should be written to determine which mouse is in the lead.  What parameters does it need?  What should it return?

	STEP 9
	Formalized Display - format the lap number.

	The output should read something like this:
	After the 6th lap, Mickey is in the lead.

	Hint: Use the getNumericSuffix function
